# Airline-Seating-Algorithm

Rules for seating:

• Always seat passengers starting from the front row to back, starting from the left to the right
• Fill aisle seats first followed by window seats followed by center seats (any order in center seats)

Below are the points to be noted:

1. The Logic / Data structure / Algorithm used to successfully complete the programming challenge
2. The elegance of the code, modularity and readability
3. A VISUAL output that is printed (on the screen, in a console or exported to a file etc.) in way that is easy to read, identify the aisle, middle and window rows and has clear seating plan and passenger number.
4. Testability, TDD and test cases
